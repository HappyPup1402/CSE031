TPS 1
1. text segment = 0x00400000 and Data segment = 0x10010000
2.  They are different in the ways that the differnt commands and addresses are referenced with the Source Code showing the lines of code.
    the Basic code showing the hex value of the addresses as well as for integer values.
3. there is a difference of 20 bytes between addresses in the data segment
4. there are 8 columns for every address
5. the columns represent the bytes that are in between each row and the addresses in that space

8. Done

10. Characters are stored the same way however they are stored in reverse order
11. li $vo, 4 allows us to print a string
12. there is an error when I assemble the code. The label has not been loaded into a register so we cant
    load its address into another register

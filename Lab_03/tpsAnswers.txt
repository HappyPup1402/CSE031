TPS 1
1. 3 pools of memory are stack memory, heap memory, and dynammic memory. stack memory stores temporary variables,
   heap memory stores pointer variables, and dyammic memory stores variables whos address has yet to be defined

2. a.   3 variables
   b. 2 are pointers, ptr points to num and handle is pointing to ptr
   c. num is stored on the stack and ptr and handle are stored on the heap
   d. ptr will point to the heap

3. Done
4. Done

TPS 2
1. the program creates 3 variables, iValue, fValue, and Node *next. The main functions allocates memory for
   the struct node *head and then assigns values for iValue and fValue
2. Done
3. structs are stored on the stack, the pointer head points to the heap and then points to the memory that was declared on the stack
   by the struct
